This site is a knowledge base for [ingenieux](http://www.ingenieux.com.br/) projects ([listed here](../projects/)).

Its purpose is to help users get from zero to hero in record time. It is based on our experience with customers
how to leverage the features of our projects.

In particular, you can [clone this site](http://bitbucket.org/ingenieux/docs.ingenieux.com.br/). It is powered by the excellent [JBake](https://github.com/jonbullock/JBake/) and our [jbake-maven-plugin](http://bitbucket.org/ingenieux/jbake-maven-plugin). Content is prototyped locally then deployed into AWS S3. Feel free to add questions, or better yet: clone and submit your pull request with changes :)
